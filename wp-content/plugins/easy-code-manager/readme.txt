Easily add CSS, JavaScript, PHP or HTML code to your website with our responsive code management plugin.

== Description ==
Easy Code Manager (ECM) is a powerful code management plugin for WordPress that gives you the tools to easily customise the appearance and functionality of your website. It allows you to add CSS, JavaScript, PHP or HTML code to unique code blocks and assign them anywhere.

= ECM is great for =
- adding front-end customisations
- modifying themes safely
- developing new functionality
- streamlining development work
- coding on devices (i.e. tablets)
- adding tracking and advertising scripts
- adding free scripts from GitHub
- creating and testing your own scripts
- teaching yourself or others how to code
- coding in CSS, JavaScript, PHP, or HTML
- and a million more other uses

= How does it work? =
Easy Code Manager is designed to be easy to learn and fun to use. In fact, adding scripts and styles can be done in as little as two steps:
- adding your code directly into unique code blocks
- assigning where these code blocks go

ECM code blocks can be assigned to the header of pages, posts, and categories.  If you require more placement accuracy, then you can use code block shortcodes and place them directly in the editor of your page or post.

== Installation ==
1. If you're upgrading from older versions its highly recommended to backup your database before upgrading.
2. Upload the ‘easy-code-manager’ folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Click ‘Easy Code Manager’ link in the main navigation (left side of your Dashboard).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why was the ECM plugin developed and what is it used for? =
The ECM plugin was created to help website authors write their own code. The plugin allows you to contribute to your WordPress installation code via a simple web interface, where you can modify and extend the functionality and appearance of your website by writing code directly into ECM code blocks. A typical example of using the plugin can include changing the the way a specific WordPress page is displayed, or making a page more interactive by adding some JavaScript (Dynamic HTML).

= What is a ECM ‘code block’? =
The ECM code block is the basic unit for writing code and to associate it with specific WordPress requests.

= What is the Assignment Panel? =
The Assignment Panel is a tabs window, which appears on the right side of the code block editor and is used to assign/apply the code block into specific requests.

= Can you select more than one item from the Assignment Panel? = 
Yes. You can select any number of items you need, there is no limitation regarding this.

= Can you assign multiple blocks to the same items from the Assignment Panel? =
Yes. It’s one of the most useful features that ECM supports as it allows you to manage/split your codes into several code blocks, allowing you to override code in a former (or lower ordered) code block.

= What are Pages, Posts, and Categories tabs? =
These lists with checkboxes represent all of your WordPress Pages, Posts, and Categories that your entire website contains. It also supports subpages and sub-categories, which you will also find in there.

= Can I use shortcodes in my posts or pages for the code blocks? =
Yes, you can use shortcodes to insert code blocks onto your desired post or page.

= Can I move the blocks around? =
Yes, by hovering your mouse cursor over the code block title bar until it turns into a four-sided arrow, this allow you to move the blocks. Clicking the block title bar allows you to open and close the blocks.

= Are code blocks saved after I click 'Create' in 'Create New Code Block' form? =
Yes. The block is created and saved in your database. In order to discard the block, you have to delete it.

= Are ordering of code blocks immediately saved after drag-and-drop actions?  =
No. In order to save the new code block order, you need to press ‘Save All Changes’ button.

= Are code blocks permanently deleted after it has been removed from the blocks list page? =
No. After you delete the code block, you need to click ‘Save All Changes’ button.

= I received a weird error, what do I do now? =
We try to cover most of the issues here but there is always a possibility of unexpected errors. Please post your issue or question in our Support Forum on WordPress.org and we will try our best to assist you further.
